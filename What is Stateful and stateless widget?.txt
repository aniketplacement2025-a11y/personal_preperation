                 WHAT IS WIDGET IN FLUTTER?
In flutter, everything is a widget - buttons, text, images, layouts, even
the entire screen. Widgets describe how the UI should look at a given
moment.

                   STATELESS WIDGET:
   DEFINITION (Simple)
A StatelessWidget is a widget whose UI does not change after it is built.
 *It does not store mutable state.
 *Once created, it cannot update itself.
 *Any change requires rebuilding the widget from outside.

  KEY CHARACTERS
* Immutable (data cannot change).
* No 'setState()'.
* Faster & lightweight.
* Used for static UI.

  EXAMPLES:
* Text     *Icon    *Image    *Button (UI only)     *Static screens
