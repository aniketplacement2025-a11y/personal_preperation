                  SHORT DIRECT ANSWER
Yes, REST API Integration, reusable widget creation and UI optimization
are primarily part of Front End developement,
but REST API Integration also overlaps with Back End responsibilities.

       DETAILED & GENUINE EXPLANATION(SAY THIS CONFIDENTLY) 
  1) REST API INTEGRATION -  FRONTEND OR BACKEND?
It is a shared responsibility.
 WHY? 
  BACKEND:
  *Designs APIs (endpoints, request/response structure).
  *Handles business logic, database, security, authentication.
 FRONTEND (Flutter):
 *Consumes APIs.
 *Sends requests with proper headers, tokens, parameters.
 *Parses JSON responses.
 *Handles loading states, errors, retries, pagination.
 *Maps API data to UI models.

=> In my role as a FLutter Developer, I worked on:
 *Integrating REST APIs using http/dio.
 *Handling JSON parsing, status codes, error states.
 *Managing token based authentication.
 *Showing correct UI for loading, success, empty, and error status.
So, API integration is definitely part of frontend, but API creation is
backend.

 2) REUSABLE WIDGET CREATION - FRONTEND OR NOT?
This is 100% Frontend responsibility.
 WHY?
 *Reusable widgets improve:
  *Code readability.
  *Maintainability.
  *Performance.
  *Scalability of the app.
 In Flutter:
  *Everything is a widget.
  *Creating reusable widgets means:
   *Buttons.
   *TextFields.
   *Cards.
   *Dialogs.
   *Common layouts.

=> In my work, I focused on:
 *Creating custom reusable widgets.
 *Passing data via constructors.
 *Keeping UI consistent across screens.
 *Reducing duplicate code.

 Example (you can say verbally):
  "Instead of rewriting UI again and again, I created reusable widgets 
 and reused them across multiple screens, which made the app cleaner and
 easier to maintain."
This is pure frontend engineering.

  3. Ui Optimization - Frontend or Not?
 UI optimization is completely Frontend.
 WHY?
  Ui optimization includes:
  *Reducing unnecessary rebuilds.
  *Using 'const' widgets.
  *Proper state management.
  *Efficient layouts.
  *Image and list optimization.
=> In Flutter, I handled:
 *Smooth scrolling using 'ListView.builder'.
 *Avoiding heavy widgets in rebuilds.
 *Managing state efficiently.
 *Improving app responsiveness and user experience.
UI optimization directly affects:
 *App performance    *User satisfaction    *Battery usage
           *App smoothness
Backend has no control over UI performance.

       STRONG COMBINED INTERVIEW ANSWER (Say Like This):
REST API integration, reusable widget creation and UI optimization
are primarily frontend responsibilities, but REST API integration is 
a shared responsibility between frontend and backend.

Backend developers create and expose APIs, while frontend developers 
integrate those APIs, handle data parsing, error handling, 
authentication, and present the data efficiently on the UI.

Reusable widget creation and UI optimization are completely frontend 
tasks. In flutter, everything is widget based, so creating reusable
widgets and optimizing UI performance is essential for maintainability
and a smooth user experience.

In my experience as a Flutter Developer Intern, I actively worked on API
integration, reusable UI components, and optimizing screens for better
performance, which are all critical frontend responsibility.
