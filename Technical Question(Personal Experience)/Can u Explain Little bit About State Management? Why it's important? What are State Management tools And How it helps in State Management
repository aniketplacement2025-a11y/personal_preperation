       WHAT IS STATE MANAGEMENT? (HOW U SHOULD EXPLAIN)
State management is the way we store, update, and share data (state) in an
application so that the UI always shows the correct and latest information.
In simple words:
   State = currect data of the app.
Example:
  *Is the user logged in or not?
  *Is the Button loading?
  *What data came from API?
  *Which item is selected?
In Flutter, whenever state changes, the UI needs to rebuild to reflect
that changes. Managing this properly is called State Management.

           WHY IS STATE MANAGEMENT IMPORTANT?
State management is important because as an application Grows, handling Ui
updates and data flow manually becomes complex, error - prone and hard
to maintain.
   PROBLEM WITHOUT PROPER STATE MANAGEMENT:
 *Too many 'setState()' calls.
 *Data mismatch between screens.
 *Rebuilding unnecessary widgets -> poor performance.
 *Difficult debugging.
 *Tight coupling between UI and logic.
   BENEFITS:
 *Clean Code.
 *Better performance.
 *Easy debugging
 *Scalable architecture.
 *Reusable logic.
