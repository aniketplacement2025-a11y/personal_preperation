        WHAT IS SCAFFOLD IN FLUTTER?
In flutter, Scaffold is a material design layout structure that provides
a basic visual framework for an application screen. It helps us build a 
standard app page by offering predefined slots like AppBar, Body, Drawer,
BottomNavigationBar, FloatingActionButton, and more.

        WHY DO WE USE SCAFFOLD?
Explain the problem first (Interviewers like this):
  Without Scaffold, we would have to manually manage layout, positioning,
  Safe areas and UI behaviours like snackbars or drawers. Scaffold 
  simplifies this by giving us a ready made screen structure.
  Key reasons: 
   *Providers Material Design UI.
   *Manages screen layout.         *Handles Ui behaviors automatically
    *Reduces boilerplate code.

          MAIN COMPONENTS OF SCAFFOLD?
Explain only important ones (don't overdo it):
 1. 'appBar': Top bar of the screen
    Used for title, navigation icons, actions.
  Example:     appBar: AppBar( title: Text("Home"), )
 2. 'body': main content of the screen.
  * Can contain any widget (Column, ListView, Form, etc).
  Example:     body: Center( child: Text("Welcome"), )
 3. 'drawer': Side navigation menu.
  * Slides from left.
  Example:     drawer: Drawer()
 4. 'bottomNavigationBar': Used for app wide navigation.
  Example:    bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(...)
 5. 'floatingActionButton': Circular action button.
   *Used for primary actions.
  Example: floatingActionButton: 
        FloatingActionButton( onPressed: () {}, ) 
 6. 'snackBar' &  'bottomSheet':
 * Used for messages and temporary UI feedback
   (Works only inside Scaffold).

         EXAMPLE (EXMPLAINING WHILE SHOWING)
 Scaffold( 
   appBar: AppBar( title: Text('My App'),),
   body: Center( child: Text('Hello Flutter'), ),
   FloatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
    onPressed: () {},  child: Icon(Icons.add),
   )
);

       Important Interview Point (VERY IMPORTANT)
 Scaffold works only with MaterialApp
   Say this clearly:
 Scaffold follows Material Design principles, so it must be used inside
 a "MaterialApp". Otherwise, widgets like AppBar or SnackBar will not
 work properly.
