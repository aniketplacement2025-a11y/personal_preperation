1. Flutter Is Developed By google in Compedition of React Native(Meta).
2. Flutter Uses Dart Programming language Instead JavaScript.
3. Flutter has it's own GUI rendering Engine call Skia While 
     React has it's own Native components.
4. Ui is build Using widgets Instead of JavaScript Bridge.
5. Performance is very close to native While
  React Native has Performance good but bridge can cause delay.
6. Same Ui on Android, iOS, Web and Desktop Not Mostly focused 
  On Mobile apps.

           WHY DID U CHOOSE OVER FLUTTER OVER REACT
I chose Flutter over React Native mainly because of it's performance,
Ui consistency and long term scalability.
   Reason 1: Better Performance:
 i. Flutter Does not use a Javascript bridge.
 ii. Ui is rendered directly using skia engine.
 iii. Results in faster and smoother apps.
      Reason 2: Ui Consistency:
   i. Flutter provides its own widgets.
  ii. App looks exactly the same on Android and iOS.
  iii. No platform specific Ui issues.
    Reason 3: Easy for Java / OOP Background
 i. Dart is object oriented
 ii. Syntax is similar to java.
  iii. Easy transition for someone like me with Java Knowledge.
   Reason 4: Single Codebase for Multiple Platforms
   Reason 5: Strong Community & Google Support
 *Backed by Google.
 *Growing demand in startups and enterprises.
