                 WHAT IS AN APK?
APK(Android Package Kit) is the file format used to distribute and install
Android applictions.
  Simple Explanation
An APK is like a.exe file in Windows. It contains everything required to run
an Android app on a device.
      WHAT AN APK CONTAINS?
An APK is actually a ZIP archive that includes:
 * AndroidManifest.xml - app name, permission, activities.
 * classes.dex - compiled Java/Kotlin code (Dalvik bytecode).
 * resources.arsc - compiled resources.
 * res/- layouts, images, strings.
 * META - INF/- app signature (for security).
      HOW APK IS GENERATED?
1. You write code in Java/Kotlin. 
2. Gradle compiles it.
3. Code converts into DEX files.
4. Resources + code are bundled into an APK.
5. APK is digitally signed.
6. Installed via:
  *Google Play store     *Direct download      *ADB command
      WHY SIGNING IS IMPORTANT?
 *Ensures app integrity.        *Android will not install unsigned APKs.
 *Confirms developer identity. 

                      WHAT IS AN IPA?
IPA (iOS App Store Package) is the file format used to distribute and 
install IOS applications.
    Simple Explanation:
 An IPA is like an APK for IOS, but it is more restricted and secure.
    WHAT AN IPA CONTAINS:        
 * .app folder (compiled Swift/ Objective-C code).
 * info.plist - configuration details.
 * Assets & resources.           *Embedded provisioning profile.
 * Digital signature.
      HOW IPA IS GENERATED:
 1. Code written in Swift / Objective-C.
 2. Compiled using Xcode.
 3. App is packaged into an IPA.
 4. Signed using:
      *Apple Developer Certificate.      *Provisioning Profile.
 5. Distributed via:
  *Apple App Store.         *TestFlight       *Enterprise distribution
       STRICT APPLE SECURITY:
 *IPA cannot be installed freely
 *Must be signed with Apple - Issued certificates.
 *iOS does not allow sideloading easily.

         ONE LINE STRONG INTERVIEW ANSWER (IF SHORT TIME)
APK is the installation package for Android apps, containing compiled
code, resources and permissions, while IPA is the installation 
package for iOS apps, signed and distributed strictly through Apple's
ecosystem for security.
