          SHORT & STRONG INTERVIEW ANSWER (START WITH THIS):
In Postman, Form Data and Raw Data are two different ways of sending data
in the request body.
Form Data is mainly used when we need to send key value pairs or files,
while Raw Data is used when we want to send structured data like JSON or
XML in a specific format.

Then u expand (This is where u score points).
    FORM DATA IN POSTMAN (multipart/form-data)
 What it is:
  *Form Data sends data as key-value pairs.
  *It uses 'multipart/form-data' content type.
  *Commonly used in HTML forms and file uploads.
 Example (Postman -> Body -> form-data)
 Key              Value             Type
 name        Aniket Rathore          Text
 email       aniket@gmail.com        Text
 resume       resume.pdf             File

    REAL WORLD USE CASES (VERY IMPORTANT FOR INTERVIEW)
When we upload images, documents or files along with text data, we
use Form Data.
Example: *Uploading Aadhaar image.         *Uploading profile picture.
 *Submitting a form with attachments.
