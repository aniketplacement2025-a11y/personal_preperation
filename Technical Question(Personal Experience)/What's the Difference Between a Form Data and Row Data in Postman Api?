          SHORT & STRONG INTERVIEW ANSWER (START WITH THIS):
In Postman, Form Data and Raw Data are two different ways of sending data
in the request body.
Form Data is mainly used when we need to send key value pairs or files,
while Raw Data is used when we want to send structured data like JSON or
XML in a specific format.

Then u expand (This is where u score points).
    1. FORM DATA IN POSTMAN (multipart/form-data)
 What it is:
  *Form Data sends data as key-value pairs.
  *It uses 'multipart/form-data' content type.
  *Commonly used in HTML forms and file uploads.
 Example (Postman -> Body -> form-data)
 Key              Value             Type
 name        Aniket Rathore          Text
 email       aniket@gmail.com        Text
 resume       resume.pdf             File

    REAL WORLD USE CASES (VERY IMPORTANT FOR INTERVIEW)
When we upload images, documents or files along with text data, we
use Form Data.
Example: *Uploading Aadhaar image.         *Uploading profile picture.
 *Submitting a form with attachments.
 BACKEND PERSPECTIVE (Java/Servlet)
* Data is received using 'request.getParameter()'.
* Files are handled using 'MultipartConfig' or Libraries like Apache 
  Commons File Upload.

  2. RAW DATA IN POSTMAN:
 What it is:
  *Raw Data sends the entire body as a single block.
  *Mostly used for JSON, XML or plain text.
  *Content-Type is explicitly defined.
   Example (Postman -> Body -> raw -> JSON)
   { 
"name": "Aniket Rathore", "email": "aniket@gmail.com", "password": "123456"
   }
   Content - Type Header
     Content-Type: application/json

   REAL WORLD USE CASE:
Raw Data is mostly used in REST APIs, especially for:
 *Login  *SignUp  *API to API communication 
 *Mobile & frontend apps (Flutter, React, Angular).

  3. WHEN TO USE WHAT (THIS LINE IMPRESSES INTERVIEWERS)
 If i need to send files or form like data, I use Form Data.
 If I'm building a REST API where data is structured, I use Raw JSON.

  4. BONUS: WHY RAW JSON IS PREFERRED IN MODERN APIs
 *Lightweight      *Easy to parse     *Language independent
 *Works perfectly with Flutter, React, Angular.
 *Industry standard for REST APIs.

  5. ONE LINE FINAL ANSWER (FOR HR/QUICK ROUND)
Form Data is used to send key value data and files, while Raw Data is used
to send structured data like JSON in REST APIs.
