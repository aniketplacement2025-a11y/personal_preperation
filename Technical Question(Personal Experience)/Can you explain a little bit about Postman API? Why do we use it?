Postman is an API developement and testing tool that allows us to design,
test, debug and document APIs without writing a frontend.
It helps developers and testers to interact directly with backend services
using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

In real projects, especially backend focused ones, APIs are created before
the UI. Postman acts as a client that sends requests to the server and
shows the response clearly, which makes development and testing mush faster.

                 WHY WE USE POSTMAN?
 1. TO TEST APIs WITHOUT FRONTEND:
 When we build APIs in flutter framework, the frontend may not be ready yet.
 With Postman:
  *I can send requests manually.
  *Pass parameters, headers and body.
  *Verify whether the API is working correctly.
 => This is very useful in backend development.

 2. TO VERIFY REQUEST & RESPONSE:
 Postman helps us check:
  *Request URL.         *HTTP method       
  *Headers (Authorization, Content - Type).
  *Body (JSON/Form-Data).
  *Response status codes like 200, 201, 400, 401, 500.
  *Response data in JSON format.
 This helps in debugging issues quickly.

 3. FOR CRUD OPERATIONS:
 Using Postman, we can easily test:
  *POST -> create data (like user registration).
  *GET -> fetch data.
  *PUT / PATCH -> update data.
  *DELETE -> remove data.
 In projects, Postman is very helpful to test:
 *User registration APIs.
 *LOGIN & Authentication APIs.
 *VOTE submission APIs.
 *RESULT fetching APIs.

 4. AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY TESTING:
  Postman supports:
   *JWT tokens.
   *Bearer tokens.
   *Basic Auth.
   *API keys.
 So, we can test secured APIs by adding tokens in headers and verify 
 whether authorization is working properly.

    SIMPLE ONE LINE SUMMARY (VERY IMPORTANT)
Postman is used to test, debug and validate APIs efficiently without
depending on the frontend, ensuring that backend services work correctly 
and securely.
