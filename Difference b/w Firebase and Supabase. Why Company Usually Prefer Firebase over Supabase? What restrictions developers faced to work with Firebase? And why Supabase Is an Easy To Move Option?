            D/W FIREBASE AND SUPABASE?  
Firabase is a backend as a Service(BaaS) platform that provides a fully
managed, serverless backend where Google controls most of the 
Infrastructure.
It focus on:
 i. Speed of development.                  ii. Real time apps.
          ii. Deep integration with Google Cloud.

Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative built on PostgreSQL. 
It gives:       *SQL Based relational database.
 *More backend Control.
 *Easier migration and self hosting options.
Supabase is more like "Backend with freedom" rather than fully 
 abstracted backend.

  WHY COMPANIES USUALLY PREFER FIREBASE OVER SUPABASE?    
1. Google Trust & Stability:
 Firebase is backed by Google, which gives companies:
   *Long term reliablity.          *Enterprise grade infrastructure.
              *Strong SLA (Service level Agreement)
For large companies, risk matters more than flexibility.

2. Faster Time to Market:
  Firebase allows companies to:    *Build MVPs very fast.
  *Avoid backend engineering efforts.
  *Focus more on UI & product logic.
 No need to manage:
  *Servers.       *Database scaling.       *Security patches.
 This is critical for statups and rapid prototyping.

 3. Mature Ecosystem:   Firebase has:
Firebase has: Analytics *Google Analytics
 *Crashlytics      *Cloud Messaging(FCM)       *Remote Config
 *App Distribution
 All tightly integrated.
 Companies don't want to combine multiple tools.

 4. Auto Scaling Without Thinking
Firebase automatically scales:
 *Database             *Authentication         *Cloud Functions.
Developers don't worry about 
 *Load            *Traffic spikes     *Infrastructure tuning

 5. Strong Mobile (Android/Flutter) Support
 Firebase is industry standard for:
 *Android apps.                *Flutter apps
          *Mobile First companies
 Docs, example and community support are huge.

   RESTRICTIONS & PROBBLEMS DEVELOPERS FACE WITH FIREBASE
This is where interviewers want honesty.
 1. Vendor Lock in (BIGGEST ISSUE)
Firebase tightly locks u into:
 *Google ecosystem.          *Proprietary APIs      
 *Non standard database queries.

 2. Expensive at Scale
 Firebase pricing is:
  *Pay-as-you-go                 *Hard to predict
               *Can suddenly spike.
 Many startups face unexpected bills when traffic increases.

   WHY SUPABASE IS AN EASY & SMART MOVE OPTION:
  1. Uses PostgreSQL (industry Standard):
 Supabase uses PostgreSQL, which gives:
