            D/W FIREBASE AND SUPABASE?  
Firabase is a backend as a Service(BaaS) platform that provides a fully
managed, serverless backend where Google controls most of the 
Infrastructure.
It focus on:
 i. Speed of development.                  ii. Real time apps.
          ii. Deep integration with Google Cloud.

Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative built on PostgreSQL. 
It gives:       *SQL Based relational database.
 *More backend Control.
 *Easier migration and self hosting options.
Supabase is more like "Backend with freedom" rather than fully 
 abstracted backend.

  WHY COMPANIES USUALLY PREFER FIREBASE OVER SUPABASE?    
1. Google Trust & Stability:
 Firebase is backed by Google, which gives companies:
   *Long term reliablity.          *Enterprise grade infrastructure.
              *Strong SLA (Service level Agreement)
For large companies, risk matters more than flexibility.

2. Faster Time to Market:
  Firebase allows companies to:    *Build MVPs very fast.
  *Avoid backend engineering efforts.
  *Focus more on UI & product logic.
 No need to manage:
  *Servers.       *Database scaling.       *Security patches.
 This is critical for statups and rapid prototyping.

 3. Mature Ecosystem:   Firebase has:
