In my previous opportunity, my contribution was mainly in development,
debugging and improving existing features.

I worked closely with senior developers and followed assigned tasks related
REST api integration ,Ui optimization and Reusable 
widget creation. My main contribution was writing clean and reusable code,
fixing bugs and implementing features as per requirements.

On the frontend side, I worked with Flutter Ui to build user - friendly
screens and ensure proper data flow from APIs. I also handle form 
validation and user input checks to avoid incorrect data submission.

I actively participated in debugging issues like null pointer exceptions,
API response handling and form submission errors. Whenever an issue came, 
I first tried to analyze it myself and then discussed it with the team to
understand best practices.

Apart from coding, I contributed by testing features, improving UI flow,
and making sure the application behaved correctly in edge cases. I also 
learned how to work in a team environment, follow deadlines and take 
ownership of assigned modules.

Overall, my contribution helped in stabilizing the application, reducing
bugs and delivering features on time while continuously improving my
technical and problem - solving skills.
