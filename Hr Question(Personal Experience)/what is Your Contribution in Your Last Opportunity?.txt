In my previous opportunity, my contribution was mainly in development,
debugging and improving existing features.

I worked closely with senior developers and followed assigned tasks related
REST api integration ,Ui optimization and Reusable 
widget creation. My main contribution was writing clean and reusable code,
fixing bugs and implementing features as per requirements.

On the frontend side, I worked with Flutter Ui to build user - friendly
screens and ensure proper data flow from APIs. I also handle form 
validation and user input checks to avoid incorrect data submission.
