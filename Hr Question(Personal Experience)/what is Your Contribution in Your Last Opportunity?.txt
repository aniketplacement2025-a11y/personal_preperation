In my previous opportunity, my contribution was mainly in development,
debugging and improving existing features.
I worked closely with senior developers and followed assigned tasks related
REST api integration ,Ui optimization and Reusable 
widget creation. My main contribution was writing clean and reusable code,
fixing bugs and implementing features as per requirements.
