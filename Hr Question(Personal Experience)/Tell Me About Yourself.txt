I am a 2025 B.Tech graduate in Computer Science Engineering from 
Shri Vaishnav Vidhyapeeth Vishwavidhyalaya. I recently completed 
my internship as 
"flutter Developer Intern" at VKAPS IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Where
I'm gaining hands on experience in building cross platform
mobile applications.

During my internship, I have worked on flutter development, including
REST API handling, reusable widget creation and
Ui optimization to ensure smooth performance across Android and iOS devices.
I have also developed some projects.

Technically i have strong foundation in Dart, flutter with basic backend
conecpts, along with good problem solving and debugging skills. I enjoy
learning new technologies and quickly adapting to new challenges.

Apart from technical work, I like playing chess and reading, which help me 
improve my analytical thinking and decision making skills.

I am now looking for full - time flutter Developer opportunity where i can
apply my skills, learn from experienced professionals and contribute to 
building impactful mobile applications.
