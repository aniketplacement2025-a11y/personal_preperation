'Tijori+' is a Flutter application designed to be a digital locker.
It allows users to securely store and organize various types of 
documents. Based on my exploration of the code.
Here's a breadkdown of what the app does:

                 CODE FUNCTIONALITY:
The main purpose of the app is to provide a secure place for users to
manage their important documents digitally. This could include things
like contracts, warranties, appointments and other personal records.

*User Flow:
 1. The app starts with a splash screen.
 2. New users are guided through an onboarding process that highlights 
    the app's features.
 3. After onboarding, users are presented with options to register, login
    in or enter as a guest.
 4. Once logged in, users are taken to the main landing page of the app.

*Technical Details:
 *It's built with Flutter, which means it can run on Android, iOS and
  potentially other platforms from a single codebase.
 *It uses several common Flutter libraries, including http and dio for 
 network requests (likely for communicating with a server),
 shared_preferences for storing data locally (like login tokens), and
 provider for state management.

In essence, it's a comprehensive document management solution for
individuals, allowing them to keep their important information 
organized and accessible in one place.
