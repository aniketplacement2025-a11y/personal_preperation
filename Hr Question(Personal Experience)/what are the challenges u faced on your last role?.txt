In my last role as a Flutter Developer Intern, I encountered several 
challenges that contributed significantly to my technical growth.

One of the key challenges was managing backend integration and smooth 
data flow while working with Provider-based state management, REST APIs, 
and JSON data extraction.

I faced issues like null data being passed between widgets and models and 
problems caused by using incorrect HTTP methods. Debugging these issues 
was time-consuming, as even minor mistakes in parameter mapping or API 
configuration could affect the entire application flow.

To address this, I adopted a more structured debugging approach by 
verifying API responses, logging data at different stages, and testing 
components individually before integration. This approach helped improve 
application reliability and reduced runtime errors.

These experiences strengthened my problem-solving skills and taught me 
the value of strong fundamentals and clean architecture. As a result, I 
am now more confident in handling backend integration and building 
scalable Flutter applications.
