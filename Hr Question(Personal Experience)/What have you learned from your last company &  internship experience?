From my last company and internship experience, 
I learned a lot—both technically and professionally.

Technically, my biggest learning was understanding how theoretical 
knowledge is applied in real-world projects. During my Flutter Development
internship, I worked on complete modules instead of just small tasks. 
I gained hands-on experience in Flutter development, including REST API
integration, UI optimization, and custom widget development.

I also learned how to debug real production-level issues, not just write
code. For example, I faced issues related to null pointer exceptions, 
form handling (GET vs POST), database connectivity, and data validation. 
Through this, I learned how to analyze logs, trace errors, and fix 
problems systematically instead of guessing.

Professionally, I learned how important communication and clarity are in 
a team environment. I learned how to ask the right questions, take 
feedback positively, and improve my work based on reviews. Initially, 
I focused only on making the code work, but later I understood the 
importance of clean code, proper naming conventions, and maintainability.

I also learned time management and responsibility. I had deadlines 
to meet, tasks to complete independently, and expectations to deliver
working features—not just attempts. This experience made me more 
disciplined and confident in handling tasks end-to-end.

Overall, my last company experience helped me transition from a student
mindset to a developer mindset. It taught me how to learn continuously,
adapt quickly to new technologies, and take ownership of my work. 
This experience has prepared me to contribute effectively to a professional
development team.
