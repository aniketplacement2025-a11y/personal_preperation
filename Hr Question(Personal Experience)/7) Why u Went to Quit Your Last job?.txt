                     BEST & SAFE ANSWER:
As someone at the early stage of my career, I want to build a strong
technical foundation in flutter development. In my previous role, the
learning opportunities and technical exposure were limited and i felt that
continuing there would slow down my growth.
                            OR
After careful self evaluation, I decided it was better to step back,
upskill myself and look for a role where i can contribute meaningfully
while continously learning. This decision was purely about professional 
growth and long term career alignment.

                   WHAT EXACTLY WAS MISSING?
I was looking for deeper involvement in core development - working with
structure codebase, backend logic, database and real problem solving. 
While the team was supportive, the role didn't provider enough technical 
challenges to grow in that direction.

            WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE YOU WON'T LEAVE US?
That's a fair question. This time, i am very clear about what i'm looking
for hands on development, learning from experienced developers and long
term contribution. From what I've learned about this role and company,
it aligns well with my goals, which is why I'm genuinely interested in
growing here.
