           EXPLAINING THE TIJORI+ PROJECT
  THE PITCH
one of the most significant projects I've worked on is 'Tijori+'
a secure digital locker application built with Flutter.
The primary goal of this project was to provide users with a
single, organized and secure platform to manage there important
life documents - everything from contracts , warranties to medical
records and personal affairs.
The idea was to eliminate the hassle of physical paperwork and create
a digital 'safe' that is accessible anytime, anywhere.

  MY ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITES:
As a key developer on this project, I was responsible for 
the end to end development of the mobile application.
This included:
Designing and Implementing the User Interface (UI):
   I translated the design mockup into a fully functional and responsive 
   user interface using flutter's widget system.
Building the code application logic:
   I handled the business logic for features like user authentication,
   document management and category organization.
API Integration: 
   I managed the communication between the app and the backend server,
   handling tasks like fetching, uploading and updating user data and
   documents.
State Management: 
   I was responsible for implementing a robust state management solution
   to ensure data consistency and a smooth user experience across the 
   app.

  TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE:
Let me break down the technical architecture of the application.
Framework:
   The entire application was build using Flutter and the Dart 
   programming language. This allowed us to have a single codebase
   for both android and iOS, which was a major advantage in terms of
   developement speed and maintenance.
Architecture & State Management:
   We used the "Provider" package for State management. This choice
   was ideal because it offers a simple yet powerful way to manage the
   app's state, making it easy to separate business logic from the UI.
   for Example, 
      when a user logs in, their authentication state is managed
   by a provider, which then notifies the relevant parts of the UI to
   update like navigating from the login screen to the home page.
API Communication:
   For networking, we used a combination of the 'http' package for
   simple API calls and 'dio' for complex scenarios like handling
   file uploads. 'dio' was particularly useful because it provides
   out of the box support for interceptors, which we used to 
   automatically attach the user's authentication token to every 
   ongoing request.
   This kept our API calling logic clean and centralized our 
   authentication handling.
Local Storage:
   To persist user sessions, we used 'shared_perferences'. After
   a successful login, the user's access token and role
   (e.g., 'COMMERCIAL_USER') are stored locally.
   One subsequent app launches, we check for this token to determine 
   if the user is already logged in, allowing for a seamless re-entry
   into the app.
User Interface:
   A key requirement was to ensure the app looked great on a variety
   of devices. I implemented a "responsive UI" by creating a custom
   'Responsive' utility class that could detect whether the app was 
   running on a mobile, tablet or desktop sized screen. This allowed
   us to adjust layouts, font sizes and spacing dynamically, ensuring
   a consistent and user friendly experience on any device.

  KEY FEATURES I IMPLEMENTED:
I'd like to highlight a couple of key features I was directly responsive
for:
1. The Onboarding and Authentication Flow:
   I built the entire user journey from the moment the app is launched.
   This included the initital splash screens, a multi page onboarding
   experience to introduce users to the app's features, and the 
   complete registration and login system. A significant improvement
   I made was steamlining this flow by reducing unnecessary delays
   and simplifying  the navigation logic which directly improved the 
   initial user experience.
2. Document Management System: 
   I designed the system that allows users to add new documents.
   This involved creating UI components for picking files from the 
   devices (using the 'file_picker' package), handling different file
   types (using the 'mime' package to identify them), and then securly
   uploading them to the backend. The UI was designed to be intuitive,
   allowing users to categorize their documents into different "buckets"
   for better organization.

  CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS:
Of course, no project is without its challenges. One of the biggest we
faced was managing the app's initial startup sequence. The original flow
was a bit clunky, with a long 10 second splash screen followed by an 
onboarding screen, and then another screen for login/registration.
This created a poor first impression.
To solve this, I re-architected the startup logic. I reduced the splash
screen delay to 2 seconds and made the navigation smarter. Instead of
forcing users through the onboarding every time, the app now directly
navigates to the main entry point, significantly improving the time it
takes for a user to get the core functionality of the app.

 WHAT I LEARNED:
Working on "Tijori+" was a fantastic learning experience. It solidified 
my expertise in flutter and gave me a deep understanding of effective 
state management using Provider. I also gained valuable experience in
building responsive UIs that work across multiple form factors. 
Most importantly, it taught me the importance of thinking about the user
experience from the very first screen and how small optimizations in the
app's flow can have a big impact in user satusfaction.
