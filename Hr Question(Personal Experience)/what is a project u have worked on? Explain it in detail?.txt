           EXPLAINING THE TIJORI+ PROJECT
  THE PITCH
one of the most significant projects I've worked on is 'Tijori+'
a secure digital locker application built with Flutter.
The primary goal of this project was to provide users with a
single, organized and secure platform to manage there important
life documents - everything from contracts , warranties to medical
records and personal affairs.
The idea was to eliminate the hassle of physical paperwork and create
a digital 'safe' that is accessible anytime, anywhere.

  MY ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITES:
As a key developer on this project, I was responsible for 
the end to end development of the mobile application.
This included:
Designing and Implementing the User Interface (UI):
   I translated the design mockup into a fully functional and responsive 
   user interface using flutter's widget system.
Building the code application logic:
   I handled the business logic for features like user authentication,
   document management and category organization.
API Integration: 
   I managed the communication between the app and the backend server,
   handling tasks like fetching, uploading and updating user data and
   documents.
State Management: 
   I was responsible for implementing a robust state management solution
   to ensure data consistency and a smooth user experience across the 
   app.

  TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE:
Let me break down the technical architecture of the application.
Framework:
   The entire application was build using Flutter and the Dart 
   programming language. This allowed us to have a single codebase
   for both android and iOS, which was a major advantage in terms of
   developement speed and maintenance.
Architecture & State Management:
   We used the "Provider" package for State management. This choice
   was ideal because it offers a simple yet powerful way to manage the
   app's state, making it easy to separate business logic from the UI.
   for Example, 
      when a user logs in, their authentication state is managed
