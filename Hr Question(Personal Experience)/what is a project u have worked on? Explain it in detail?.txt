           EXPLAINING THE TIJORI+ PROJECT
  THE PITCH
one of the most significant projects I've worked on is 'Tijori+'
a secure digital locker application built with Flutter.
The primary goal of this project was to provide users with a
single, organized and secure platform to manage there important
life documents - everything from contracts , warranties to medical
records and personal affairs.
The idea was to eliminate the hassle of physical paperwork.
