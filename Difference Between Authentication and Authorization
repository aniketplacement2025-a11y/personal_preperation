         AUTHENTICATION - "Who are you?"
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user.
It checks whether the user is really the person they claim to be.
  *It happens first in any application.
  *it is done using credenticals.
 Common authentication methods:
  *Username & Password.
  *OTP (Email/ SMS /Phone).
  *Biometric (Fingerprint, Face ID).
  *Token - based login (JWT, OAuth).

Example: When your enter email and password on a login page, the system
         checks them against the database.
If they match -> authentication is successful.

        AUTHORIZATION - "What are you allowed to do?"
Is the process of deciding what an authenticated user can access or perform.
*It happens after authentication.
*It is based on roles, permissions or access levels.
 Common authorization types:
* Role Based Access Control(Admin, User, Manager).
* Permission Based Access.
* Policy Based Access.
   Example:
After logging in:
 *Admin can add users and view reports.
 *User can only view their own profile.
Both are authenticated, but not authorized for the same actions. 

            REAL WORLD EXAMPLE (Very interview Friendly)
 Think of a college campus:
  *"Authentication: Showing your ID card at the gate -> proves who u are".
  *"Authorization:  Accessing staff room or student lab -> depends on 
    Your role".

            TECHNICAL EXAMPLE (Software Perspective)
 In a web application:
  *Login using email + password -> Authentication.
 *Checking if user has "ROLE_ADMIN" to access '/admin/dashboard' ->
   Authorization.
 In JWT - based systems:
  * Token validation -> Authentication.
  * Checking claims like role = admin -> Authorization.

                ONE LINE INTERVIEW ANSWER: 
Authentication verifies the user's identity, while authorization determine
what actions or resources that authenticated user is allowed to access.
