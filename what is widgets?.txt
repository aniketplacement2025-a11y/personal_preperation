In Flutter, a widget is the basic building block of the user interface.
Everything u see on the screen - such as text, buttons, images, layouts
and even the app structure itself - is a widget.
Widgets describe what the UI should look like for a given state. when the
state changes, flutter rebuilds the widget tree and updates only the parts of the UI that need to change.
Widgets are immutable, meaning once they are created, they cannot be 
changed. if we want to update the UI, Flutter creates a new widget instead
of modifying the existing one.

There are mainly two types of widgets:
* StatelessWidget, which does not change its state during its lifetime.
* StatefulWidget, which can change its state dynamically, like a login form or counter app.
Flutter uses a widget tree, where widgets are nested inside each other
to build complex and responsive UIs efficiently.

         DETAILED EXPLANATION (For Your Strong Understanding)
  WHAT EXACTLY IS A WIDGET?
A Widget is not the UI itself, but a configuration or description of the UI.
Think of it like: 
 "Widgets tell Flutter how the UI should look, not draw it directly."
Flutter uses widgets to create:
 *Ui elements (Text, Button, Image)    
 *Layout (Row, Column, Stack).
 *App structure (MaterialApp, Scaffold).
Even 'MaterialApp' and 'Scaffold' are widgets.

  EVERYTHING IN FLUTTER IS A WIDGET?
This is a very important interview point. Example
 Text, Icons, Padding, Center, Scaffold -> Widget.
There is no separate XML or UI file like Android.
