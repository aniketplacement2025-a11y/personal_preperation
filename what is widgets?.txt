In Flutter, a widget is the basic building block of the user interface.
Everything u see on the screen - such as text, buttons, images, layouts
and even the app structure itself - is a widget.

Widgets describe what the UI should look like for a given state. when the
state changes, flutter rebuilds the widget tree and updates only the parts
of the UI that need to change.
