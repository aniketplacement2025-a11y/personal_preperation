flutter is a cross platform mobile application development software that allows developers
to create mobile applications that can function on both Android and iOS devices without
the need for writing separate codes for each platform.
Flutter is a free. open source UI toolkit for building high quality, natively compiled 
application for mobile, web and desktop from a single codebase.

flutter is different from other mobile app development frameworks because it uses a 
single code base for building applications for multiple platforms it includes IOS and
Android. 
Flutter also uses a reactive programming model and a unique widget based 
architecture. That allows faster rendering and customizable Ui elements.
The main features of flutter 
*Fast Development         *Expressive and Flexible UI         *Native Performance
*Cross Platform Development        *Open source.

*Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which was developed by Google.
*Dart is an object oriented, garbage collected language that is optimized for client
side development, making it a good fit for building apps with flutter.
*Dart also includes features such as asynchronous programming and just in time(JIT)
compiler, which help to improve app performance.

In Flutter, a widget is a basic building block for building user interface. Widgets
are used to create visual elements such as buttons, text fields and images and 
can be composed together to create complex UI elements.

In flutter, stateless widgets are immutable and their properties cannot change while
stateful widgets have mutable state that can change over time. Stateful widgets are
used when u need to manage state that changes dynamically, such as user input or 
network requests.

the pubspec.yaml file in flutter is used to specify the dependencies and configuration
for a flutter project. It contains information such as the project name, version and 
the packages that the project depends on.

Hot Reload the code changes and updates the UI While Restart totally restart the app 
and reloads the code and UI.
Hot Reload has Faster Execution time than restart And Hot Restart has slower 
execution time than reload.
Hot reload preserves the app state while Hot restart the app state.
Hot reload has minimal performance impact on the app performance while Restart
has Higher impact on the app performance.
Hot reload is ideal for Ui changes and quick code iteration while Restart used when
the code changes required a full app restart.
Hot reload cannot apply all code changes without restarting while Restart Requires 
more time to complete than hot reload.

The build() method in flutter is responsible for creating and updating the UI of a widget.
It is called when the first created and again whenever the widget's state changes.

The purpose of the "initState()" method is to initialize the state of the widget.
Common use cases for "initState()" method are :
I. initializing variables          2. setting up listeners       3. Fetching data
The "initState()" method in flutter is called when a stateful widget is first
created and is used to initialize the widget's state. This method is typically used 
to fetch data from an API or to set up animations or other long running tasks.

The setState method in flutter is used to update the state of a stateful widget.
which in turn triggers a rebuild of the widget's UI. This method should be called 
whenever the state of the widget changes.
class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
 @override
 _MyWidgetState createState() => _MyWidgetState();
} class _MYWidgetState extends State<Widget>{
  int _counter = 0;
 void _incrementCounter(){
  setState((){
   _counter++;
  });
 }
 @override
 Widget build(BuildContext context){
  return Scaffold(
   body : Center(
    child: Text('Counter: $_counter'),
   ),
  floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
    onPressed: _incrementCounter,
    child: Icon(Icons.add), 
   ),
  );
 }
}

In flutter, a Future is a way of representing a value or error that may not be available
yet but will be at some point in the future. A Future represents a computation that may
take some time to complete, such as loading data from a database or making an API call.
Future<List<Item>> getItemsFromDatabase() async {
 var db = await openDatabase['my_database.db'];
 var result = await db.query['items'];
 return result.map((item) => Item.fromJSON(item)).toList(); 
} getItemsFromDatabase().then((items){
 //DO SOMETHING WITH THE LIST OF ITEMS
}).catchError((error){
 // HANDLE THE ERROR. 
});

In flutter, a Future is an object that represents a computation that has not yet completed.
It is typically used for asynchronous tasks such as network requests or file I/O 
operations.

A Stream is a way of representing a sequence of asynchronous events. A Stream provides a 
way for your code to receive and respond to events as they occur, rather than waiting for a 
computation to complete.
StreamController<int> _counterController = StreamController<int>();
void _handleButtonClick(){
 _counterController.sink.add(1);
}
@override void dispose(){
 _counterController.close();
 super.dispose();
}
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context){
 return Scaffold(
 body: Center(
   child: StreamBuilder<int>(
    stream: _counterController.stream,
    initialData: 0,
    builder (context, snapshot){
     return Text('Counter: ${snapshot.data}');
    },
   ),
  ),
 floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
  onPressed: _handleButtonClick,
  child: Icon(Icons.add),
  ),
 );
}
In flutter, a Stream is a sequence of asynchronous events that can be listened to and 
processed in real time. Streams are commonly used for processing data that is countinously 
updated, such as data from a sensor or a database.

MaterialApp widget has some of the key features and benfits of material app:
*App bar and title               *Navigation            *Theming 
*Localization                *Accessibility.
The Material App widget in Flutter is a convenience widget that provides common
app level features such as navigation, theming and localization. It is typically
used as the root widget of a flutter app.

Scaffold Widget is a basic visual layout structure for your app's screens or pages.
It provides a container for app bars, navigation drawers, floating actions buttons,
bottom navigation bars and other common UI elements that are typically used in a 
mobile app.
Some of the key features of Scaffold:
1. App bar.          2. Body Content         3. Floating Action Button
4. Button Navigation Bar           5. Drawer. 

In flutter, a layout widget is a widget that arranges its child widgets in a specific way.
following a certain layout algorithm. A layout widget is used to create the visual 
structure of your app, by determining the size, position and order of the widgets
that make up your UI.
Some Examples of layout Widget:
i. Column and Row           2. Stack          3. Expanded and flexible
4. ListView and GridView. 
In Flutter, a layout widget is a widget that is used to position and size other widgets
within a parent widget. Examples of layout widgets include Row, Column and Stack.
These widgets provide different ways to arrange child widgets and control their placement
and sizing within the parent widget.

Widget Tree is a fundamental concept in flutter that represents the user interface of 
a flutter app. In flutter, everything is a widget, from the smallest visual element like 
a button or text label to entire app itself.
The Widget tree is a fundamental concept in Flutter. It represents the hierarchy of widgets 
that make up your app's UI. Each widget has a parent widget, except for the root widget which is the top level widget of your app. When a widget needs to be updated or rebuilt,
flutter traverse the widget tree to determine which widgets need to be updated, and then
updates them accordingly.

ListView can display a list of items of varying heights While GridView requires that 
all items have the same height and width.
ListView is more efficient than GridView while GridView can be used to create a 
staggered grid, where items are arranged in a grid View but can have varying heights
or widths.
ListView is a widget that displays a scrollable list of widgets, while GridView is 
a widget that displays a scrollable grid of widgets. The main difference b/w the 
two is the way they arrange their child widgets. ListView arranges its child widgets
vertically in a single column, while GridView arranges its child widgets in a grid,
either horizontally or vertically.

A Stream transformer is a class in flutter that allows u to transform a stream of
data from one form to another. It takes an input stream, applies a transformation
function to each event in the stream, and produces an output stream of transformed
events.

There are several ways to handle user input in flutter. Depending on the type of 
input and the widget you are using. For example, u can use the onPressed property
of a RaisedButton widget to handle button presses, or the onChanged property 
of the textfield widget to handle changes to a text field.

Provider is a state management library in flutter that allows to share data between
widgets efficiently and in a way that is easy to maintain. It works by providing 
a single source of truth for the app's state, which can be accessed by any widget 
in the app.
So, to use the provider u typically define a "change notifier" so this class that
represents your app's state and then wrap your apps widget in change notifier 
widget to make the state available to the other widgets so this is how the provider
works in the flutter

Flutter plugin are the packages that provide a way to access platform
specific functionality, such as accessing the device camera or sending
push notifications in flutter apps.
To create a flutter plugin, u can follow these general steps:
 *Create a new flutter plugin project using the flutter create
 --template =plugin command.
 *Implement the plugin functionality in the target platform 
 language (e.g., Java/Kotlin or Swift/Objective-C).
 *Create a platform channel that allows the flutter app to communicate
 with the plugin code.
 *Implement the plugin functionality in the flutter app using the
 platform channel.
 *Publish the plugin to a package manager such as 'pub.dev' for other
 developers to use.

Flutter provides a powerful framework that allows you to create complex
animations in your app. You can use the animation framework to animate
any property of a widget. such as it's position, size, opacity or color.
General steps to implement Animations:
 *Create an animation controller: Is used to drive the animations by
   specifying the duration like start time and the value range of the
  animations so u can create an animation controller by calling
  just an animation controller into the parameters and u can pass the 
  duration and u can sync the argument over there and then u need to 
  create an animation here.
 *Create an Animation:
  Here an animation is a value that changes over time right so usually
  a lineraly are using a curve so you can create an animation by
  calling the tween Constructor and passing it to the start and
  the ending value of the animations then you can pass the twin object
  to the Controller driver this method to create an animation object.
  after that u need to wrap the widget in an animationWidget.
 *Wrap the widget in an AnimatedWidget:
  This is a special widget that automatically rebuilds itself whenever
  the animation values changed so u can wrap the widget that u want
  to animate in an animated widget and pass it in the animation object
  then after that you need to animate the widget property.
 *Animate the widget property:
  you can use the value of the animation object to 
  animate any property of the widget.
 For example: You can use the transform.translate so this widget is to
 animate the position of the widget or you can use the animated opacity
 widget to animate the opacity of the widget so it is as simple as that
 so you can use whatever animation you want to use in your flutter
 application as your wish.

The Navigator widget is used to manage the navigation stack in a flutter
app. It allows you to push new routes onto the navigation stack, pop
routes off the stack and control the transition between screens.

In flutter, a package is a collection of Dart code that can be shared 
and reused across multiple flutter projects while a plugin, on the
other hand is a package that provides access to platform specific 
functionality such as camera or location services, in a cross 
platform way using platform channels. While packages can be purely 
dart based, plugin typically required native code developement for 
android and iOS in addition to Dart code.
