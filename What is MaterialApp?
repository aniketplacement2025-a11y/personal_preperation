It's the root widget of a flutter application that follows Google's Material
Design guidelines.
It provides the basic structure, theme, navigation and app level 
configurations required to build a complete Flutter app.
In Simple words, MaterialApp acts as a wrapper that connects your Flutter 
app With Material Design features like themes, navigation, icons, text styles 
and animations.

              WHY DO WE USE MATERIALAPP?
When we build a FLutter app, we need:
 *A consistent UI theme.
 *Navigation between screens.
 *Material widgets like Scaffold, AppBar, Buttons.
 *App - level configurations (routes, localization, debug banner).
      -> MaterialApp gives all of this in one place.
Without 'materialApp', many Material widgets 
(like Scaffold, AppBar, SnackBar) will not work properly.

           WHAT DOES 'MATERIALAPP' PROVIDE INTERNALLY?
 1. Material Design Styling: It Enables:
 *Material colors.       *Typography.        *Icons.    *Animations.
